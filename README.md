## Configuration

### Angular Build Budgets
Current production bundle size limits (configured in `angular.json`):
- Initial bundle warning: 3 MB
- Initial bundle error: 4 MB

### Environment Variables
Configure API endpoints in `src/environments/`:
- `environment.ts` (development)
- `environment.prod.ts` (production)

## Deployment

### AWS Amplify
The application is configured for AWS Amplify deployment:

1. Connect your repository to Amplify Console
2. Configure build settings (amplify.yml is included)
3. Deploy automatically on push to main branch

### Manual Deployment
Build and deploy to any static hosting:
```bash
ng build --configuration production
# Deploy contents of dist/ directory
```

## Common Issues

### Bundle Size Warnings
If you encounter bundle size errors during build, adjust budgets in `angular.json`:
```json
"budgets": [
  {
    "type": "initial",
    "maximumWarning": "3mb",
    "maximumError": "4mb"
  }
]
```

### Lock File Sync Issues
If `package-lock.json` is out of sync:
```bash
npm install
git add package-lock.json
git commit -m "Update package-lock.json"
```


### Chart Downsampling and Data Size

Sensor data files can contain tens of thousands of time-series points (e.g., 55,000+ records). To ensure smooth chart rendering and better user experience, the dashboard uses **downsampling** in the chart modal:

- **Original Size**: The modal displays the total number of points available (original size) for each file.
- **Downsampling**: A slider lets users select the downsampling rate (e.g., every 200th, 250th, ... up to 2000th point). This reduces the number of points plotted, making large datasets manageable and interactive.
- **Live Preview**: The chart updates in real time as the slider is adjusted, showing the number of points currently displayed.
- **Preserves Trends**: Downsampling keeps the overall shape and trends of the data while improving performance.

**Tip:** If the chart looks sparse or too dense, adjust the slider to find the best balance between detail and speed. The original data size is always shown for reference.

## Data Flow

1. **Metadata Loading**: API fetches combined metadata from S3 backend
2. **Grid Display**: Data is processed and displayed in AG Grid with Shimmer 1/2 columns
3. **Graph Visualization**: Clicking graph button emits time-series data to parent component
4. **Chart Rendering**: Modal opens with Chart.js rendering the time vs acceleration data

## Contributing

## About AWS Amplify

AWS Amplify is a set of tools and services that enables developers to build secure, scalable full-stack applications powered by AWS. In this project, Amplify is used for deployment, authentication, and integration with AWS S3 for sensor data storage.

**Key Amplify Features in This Project:**
- **Deployment:** Automatic builds and deployments via Amplify Console. The `amplify.yml` file defines build settings for CI/CD.
- **Authentication:** User authentication flows are managed by Amplify, as configured in the `amplify/auth` directory.
- **Storage:** Sensor data is stored and accessed through AWS S3, managed by Amplify's backend configuration.
- **Configuration:** The `amplify/` directory contains CLI and backend configuration files for resources and environment settings.
- **Integration:** The Angular app uses Amplify libraries to interact with AWS services, supporting real-time updates and secure data access.

**Deployment Workflow:**
1. Connect your repository to Amplify Console.
2. Configure build settings (see `amplify.yml`).
3. Push changes to trigger automatic deployment and backend updates.

For more information, see the [AWS Amplify Documentation](https://docs.amplify.aws/).
